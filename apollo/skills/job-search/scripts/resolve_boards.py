Resolve company names to confirmed job-board endpoints.

Part of Apollo, a free job-search plugin for Claude Code.
By Adam Hilliard - https://linkedin.com/in/adamhilliard - MIT licensed.

Why this exists: building a named-employer list is easy, but a list of names
is not sweepable. Each company needs its applicant tracking system and its
board slug, and the standing rule is never to add a row on a guessed slug.
This script does the probing so the rule is cheap to follow: it tries slug
candidates against each platform's public API and keeps only the ones that
return a real board payload. A confirmed 200 with the expected shape is not a
guess.

Feed it the output of a "major employers in <metro>" or "companies in
<industry>" search. It prints a markdown table ready to paste into
Employer_Index.md, plus the unresolved names as a separate tier.

Usage:
    python resolve_boards.py --names "Acme Health,Northwind Logistics"
    python resolve_boards.py --file companies.txt      # one name per line
    echo "Acme Co" | python resolve_boards.py

Options:
    --slow      2s between probes instead of 0.4s, for large lists
    --loose     also try shortened slugs on platforms that cannot be verified.
                Recovers boards whose slug is shorter than the company name,
                at the cost of rows you must check yourself. Off by default:
                a confident wrong board is worse than an unresolved one.
    --verbose   print every candidate tried, not just the hits

Output is two markdown tables. The first is Tier A, confirmed and sweepable
by employer_sweep.py. The second is Tier B: real companies whose board sits
on a platform without a public API, or under a slug this script could not
guess. **Tier B is unresolved access, not a negative finding.** Resolve those
by hand on a cycle where the browser is already connected, and never record
them as "no openings."
