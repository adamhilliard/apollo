"""Apply-link resolver.  Bishop, by Adam Hilliard (MIT).

Why this file exists: freshness re-verification only ever protected rows
already in the table, so a FIRST cycle protected nothing. Two independent
testers reported the same thing, from different searches and different career
levels: a first digest whose top-ranked roles and below-the-cap links opened to
"page not found." Nothing errored. Nothing had checked.

This runs BEFORE research and scoring, so a dead role costs one request instead
of a research pass and a full rubric scoring.

THE ONE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: a failed check is never an expiry.

  live        the requisition page renders
  expired     positive evidence of closure, and only from the three sources
              enumerated in EXPIRY EVIDENCE below
  unverified  the check could not run: timeout, block, JS-only shell,
              unresolvable host, anything ambiguous

Absence from a board is not expiry, and a 404 from an ATS's own per-requisition
API is not expiry either: one board's JSON omitted a requisition entirely and
its per-requisition endpoint reported the document missing, while the rendered
page served HTTP 200 with the full description, unchanged title, and unchanged
reporting line. Only the rendered page settles it.

THE CANARY IS NOT OPTIONAL. A control URL known to be live is resolved before
anything is classified. If it fails, the whole run downgrades to unverified and
NOTHING is marked expired. Without that, one proxy, rate-limit, or network blip
marks an entire table dead in a single cycle, silently and plausibly.

Usage:
    python resolve_links.py --urls-file rows.txt --canary https://known/live/req
    python resolve_links.py --urls-file rows.txt

Input is one URL per line, optionally followed by a tab and a label echoed
back. Output is one line per row, then CANARY, COUNT, and STATUS. The COUNT
line is what the weekly audit reads; keep its shape.

#    reason in a tracking parameter.
#
#    THE ABBREVIATED FORMS MATTER AS MUCH AS THE SPELLED-OUT ONES. The largest
#    board's marker is `trk=expired_jd_redirect`, and `expired_jd` matches none
#    of the `expired_job` spellings below. One word apart, and the single most
#    common expiry signal any search will meet came back `live` for three
#    releases. Found on a port, by a test written against what a board actually
#    sends rather than against what the list already had.
#
#    Match on the stem. A guess at the whole parameter name is how this broke.
